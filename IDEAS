Twitter does one thing, FB does one thing and Google Plus...well it does something. They all do one thing, and that is connecting people irrespective of location. Music is a thread that connects everyone. We want to make music discovery a cynch. 

Music discovery right is a cumbersome collection of mechanistic processes, algorithms and such. Where is the diversity? Where is the human element?

This is Aura. Aura connects you to music in two big ways:

#1 is Comfort

Comfort is about finding people near you, that are like you and discovering what they are listening to. 

Using Facebook Login ***SHOW LOGIN***, Aura connects you to people near you who share your musical tastes and provides you with a mix of their favourite songs. These songs are categorised by genre ***SHOW GENRE***, the contents of which are constantly changing based on where you find yourself. This provides a diverse everchanging set of music you can shuffle through.


#2 is Exploration

and we go global ***SWITCH TO TAB***. What do people care about around the world? Exploration is about finding people not like you, not near you, people of a different culture ***POINT TO GLOBE***. Incredible music is found along the fringe, and seldom in a place of comfort. So we built a way to navigate the different music of the world. 


That's Aura.


  
























music discovery a cinch through diversity
3 avenues:
 1. comfort: similar to theirs, lowest-level, listen to every day
 3. exploration: radically different, recommendations/algos/genres/rudimentary

1. check out other people near you
2. people not like you, still inside of your own country (guarantees), inverse of first wrt taste. the peaks within the noise, filter out the irrelevant bits. shows the popular stuff by users, but takes out the stuff you already know. - the wheel 
3. exploration: globe view of samples from different countries - apples and oranges


- value of music
- locality based
- diversity
- exploration - apples and oranges
