Twitter does one thing, FB does one thing and Google Plus...well it does something. They all do one thing, and that is connecting people irrespective of location. Music is a thread that connects everyone. We want to make music discovery a cynch. 

Music discovery right is a cumbersome collection of mechanistic processes, algorithms and such. Where is the diversity? Where is the human element?

This is Aura. Aura connects you to music in two big ways:

1. Comfort

Comfort is about finding people near you, that are like you and discovering what they are listening to. 

Using Facebook Login ***SHOW LOGIN***, Aura connects you to random people near you who share common musical tastes and provides you with an everchanging source of new music. You get a mix of everyone's favourite songs (without the one's you've already heard), which of course change all the time, categorised by genre.

That



2. Exploration

























music discovery a cinch through diversity
3 avenues:
 1. comfort: similar to theirs, lowest-level, listen to every day
 3. exploration: radically different, recommendations/algos/genres/rudimentary

1. check out other people near you
2. people not like you, still inside of your own country (guarantees), inverse of first wrt taste. the peaks within the noise, filter out the irrelevant bits. shows the popular stuff by users, but takes out the stuff you already know. - the wheel 
3. exploration: globe view of samples from different countries - apples and oranges


- value of music
- locality based
- diversity
- exploration - apples and oranges
