music discovery a cinch through diversity
3 avenues:
 1. comfort: similar to theirs, lowest-level, listen to every day
 2. challenge: not much alike
 3. exploration: radically different, recommendations/algos/genres/rudimentary

1. check out other people near you
2. people not like you, still inside of your own country (guarantees), inverse of first wrt taste. the peaks within the noise, filter out the irrelevant bits. shows the popular stuff by users, but takes out the stuff you already know. - the wheel 
3. exploration: globe view of samples from different countries - apples and oranges
